Note Taker App using Express.js

Given starter code that included a completed front-end html files, I was tasked with creating routes files to be able to connect the back-end to the front-end to make it fully functional. Previously, I'd submitted a version that did not work in Heroku, but this version works now!

I added Routes within the 'routes' folder, and was able to get the app functioning, and added a delete function as well.
